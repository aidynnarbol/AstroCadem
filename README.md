## About

Children spend significant time online but rarely learn essential life skills — managing money, protecting themselves from scams, or understanding digital advertising. AstroCadem addresses this gap by delivering education through an engaging space adventure where learning happens naturally during gameplay.

Players become cadets at a space academy, traveling to different planets and completing missions that teach:
- Financial literacy
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Digital hygiene

**Target Audience:** Children ages 8-13. Secondary audience includes parents and educators.
